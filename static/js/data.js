It enables journalists to transform any dataset into a bubble map, a choropleth map, or a pin map with GPS coordinates. They can customize and adapt each map to their needs, and then publish the generated snippet on Le Monde's website.</p>\n<p>I am working alone on this app (with advice and feedback from my supervisors). It's been a challenge, but this colossal project has allowed me to learn a lot about back-end and front-end development, databases, UX/UI, and design. I am very happy to see how things are turning out!</p>\n<p>If you'd like to see a demo, feel free to <a href=\"../../contact.html\" class=\"link\">contact me</a>!</p>",

Our newsletters included safety tips, practical information, equipment testing, the latest local biking news and testimonies.</p>\n<p>We also delved into the business side of things, and found a lot of enthusiasm when pitching our project to potential sponsors! We even started partnerships with several brands.</p>\n<p>My missions included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing part of the newsletter each week and finding new topics</li>\n<li>Coding the newsletters' layout (and finding out that emails require using these good old HTML tables)</li>\n<li>Planning weekly email campaigns via SendinBlue</li>\n<li>Creating a website for archiving and registrations</li>\n<li>Negotiating with potential sponsors to make this project economically viable</li>\n<li>Analyzing customer satisfaction surveys and data (opening rates, subscriptions…)</li>\n<li>Creating a business deck</li>\n</ul>",
